# CPC Viewer 

After you have installed the required packages using `npm i` or `yarn add`, proceed to launch the backened.

In order to do so, run `npm test` preferably, or `npm start` if you don't want to view the integration tests.

Then for the front end, `yarn serve` or `npm run serve` would suffice to kickstart the decoy viewer app.
